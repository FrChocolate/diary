If there’s one thing every human is a master of, it’s lying—to themselves.
Lying about the future, so they can hope.
Lying about the present, so they can cope.
Lying about the past, so they can live with it.

We twist facts into comfort,
wrap regrets in justification,
and dress fear in the clothes of confidence.

We don’t just lie to survive—
we lie to make meaning,
to build stories,
to keep going.

And the cruelest part?
We often believe every word.
