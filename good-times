You may like fancy web UIs in Medium, Twitter, or etc.
You may like SSO and modern CAPTCHA.

But deep in my mind, I still go to old websites.
Number-noisy CAPTCHA, username and password.
Plain CSS, no JS.
HTML tags correctly placed.

You don't understand it,
but sometimes beauty is not in design.

Beauty is when I can see the random man,
behind a CRT, small screen, lights off in his messy bedroom,
writing code â€” not for money, not for fame,
but because he loves to create.
Even simple things.

The website now is not just a website.
There is a developer's love behind every HTML tag.
There is a worried heart behind every TCP packet that leaves.
There is a stressed mind behind every SQL query.
There is a human, not depressed, not slaved by social media.
