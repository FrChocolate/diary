No fancy car.
No big house.
No wife.

Just a small company,
in a field I love—
Programming.
A decent salary,
enough to live, enough to breathe.

At five, I leave work.
The sun’s slipping down the sky,
wind brushing my face
as I drive home, slow and steady—
not rushing, just being.

I walk in.
Drop the noodle.
Change my clothes.
Come back.
Eat in silence.
Grateful.

Then maybe a game—
a world to escape to,
or just to unwind.
And when the day’s done,
I sleep.

Not rich.
Not famous.
Just free.
And that’s enough.
